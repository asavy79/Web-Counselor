# ðŸŽ“ CoursePath: Intelligent Course Planning Assistant

**CoursePath** is an AI-powered academic planning assistant that helps Computer Science students at CU Boulder understand their course requirements and prerequisites. It combines the power of a **Neo4j graph database** (still in progress) for course relationship modeling with a **chatbot powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to simulate a smart academic counselor.

## ðŸ§  Features

- ðŸ“š **Course Prerequisite Graph**  
  Store and query course dependencies using Neo4j to model complex prerequisite chains.

- ðŸ¤– **AI Counselor Chatbot**  
  Ask natural language questions about your CS degree path. Powered by RAG for accurate and contextual answers.

- ðŸ”Ž **Recursive Prerequisite Lookup**  
  Get all the required courses you must take before enrolling in a specific course (e.g., "What do I need before CS401?").

- ðŸŽ“ **Focus on Computer Science Major**  
  Currently tailored for testing with CS major requirements. More majors will be added soon.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

This project is currently **in progress**. I'm actively building out features, testing major-specific logic, and refining the chatbot's capabilities.

If you're interested in collaborating â€” whether it's for data modeling, front-end integration, or improving the AI counselor â€” feel free to reach out or open an issue! I'd love to connect.
