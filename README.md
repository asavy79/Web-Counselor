# ðŸŽ“ CoursePath: AI-Powered Course Planning (Learning Project)

**CoursePath** is a learning project I built to explore **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques in AI development. Itâ€™s a prototype chatbot that helps CU Boulder Computer Science students navigate their degree requirements and course prerequisites.

The goal was to simulate an intelligent academic counselor using a RAG-based backend that pulls course information from predefined documents.

## ðŸ§  Features

- ðŸ¤– **AI Chatbot for Course Planning**
  - Ask natural language questions like:
    - "What are the prerequisites for CS401?"
    - "What classes should I take next semester?"
  - Uses a RAG pipeline for accurate answers from structured course info.

- ðŸ”Ž **Course Prerequisite Lookup**
  - Simulates prerequisite tracing by referencing curated academic data.

- ðŸŽ“ **Focus on CU Boulder Computer Science Major**
  - Currently tailored for Computer Science undergrad courses at CU Boulder.
  - Easily extendable for other majors with updated data.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for the RAG chatbot)
- (Optional) Docker if you want to containerize your environment later

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coursepath.git
cd coursepath
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or export directly:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

---

### 3. Run the Chatbot

```bash
python app.py
```

*(Assuming your chatbot server script is called `app.py` â€” adjust if needed.)*

## ðŸ“Œ Notes


- **Learning-Focused:**  
  This project was built for learning purposesâ€”exploring LangChain, RAG, OpenAI API usage, and AI prompt engineering. Not production-ready.
